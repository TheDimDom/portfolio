          Hello, my name is George Samuels. In 2023 I completed a Software
          Development course with
          <a
            href="https://wearecodenation.com/2022/04/25/develop-coding/"
            target=""
            _blank
            >Code Nation</a
          >
          and then a 13 week full-time intensive Full Stack Software Engineering
          bootcamp with
          <a
            href="https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp"
            target="_blank"
            >Northcoders</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>Having completed these courses, I now have hands-on experience with Javascript, Typescript, Python, HTML, CSS, React, Next.js, MongoDB, TDD, SQL and a lot more. I am now learning C# in my free time as I am dedicated to continuing my learning and growth in software development.</p>
